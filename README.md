# Credit Card FraudDetection

## Introducing

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset. Dataset taken from: Kaggle.

Key objectives:

- Build a preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline.
- Address the class imbalance problem.
- Compare multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Evaluate models using metrics suitable for imbalanced data (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC).

## Pipelines
- Data Preprocessing: Descriptive Analysis, Handling Nulls and Duplicate Values, Exploratory data analysis
- Feature Engineering:
